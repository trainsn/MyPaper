%X Existing graph layout algorithms are usually not able to optimize all 
the aesthetic properties desired in a graph layout. To evaluate how well 
the desired visual features are reflected in a graph layout, many 
readability metrics have been proposed in the past decades. However, the 
calculation of these readability metrics often requires access to the 
node and edge coordinates and is usually computationally inefficient, 
especially for dense graphs. Importantly, when the node and edge 
coordinates are not accessible, it becomes impossible to evaluate the 
graph layouts quantitatively. In this paper, we present a novel deep 
learning-based approach to evaluate the readability of graph layouts by 
directly using graph images. A convolutional neural network architecture 
is proposed and trained on a benchmark dataset of graph images, which is 
composed of synthetically-generated graphs and graphs created by 
sampling from real large networks. Multiple representative readability 
metrics (including edge crossing, node spread, and group overlap) are 
considered in the proposed approach. We quantitatively compare our 
approach to traditional methods and qualitatively evaluate our approach 
using a case study and visualizing convolutional layers. This work is a 
first step towards using deep learning based methods to evaluate images 
from the visualization field quantitatively.
